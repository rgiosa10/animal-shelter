#### This is a website of an Animal Shelter. It includes a few animals on the top portion of the page and some additional sections that I was testing with on the bottom.

## Technologies Used

## Description

1. Created a new web page for an animal shelter. Listed out the animals available to be adopted, including pictures and descriptions of each animal. We have 3 animals listed. A git repository was set up, we made frequent commits and push to a remote repository on GitHub.
2. Displayed each animal's "profile" in a column.
3. Changed the styles of elements nested within the columns using the idea of cascading.
4. Ruben also incorporate bootstrap for the first time, and included some formating from that style sheet.
